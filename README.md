BusinessCore
============
BusinessCore is a very cool plugin that implements a lot of new economic features to minecraft. For one BusinessCore does as the name may imply and adds in businesses. Businesses have an owner/founder who has ultimate control over his business. He can hire employees and fire them. These employees can interact with the other part of this plugin, jobs. Jobs may be as mundane and chopping down a forest.
